In cryptography, ciphertext or cyphertext is the result of encryption performed on plaintext using an algorithm,
called a cipher.Ciphertext is also known as encrypted or encoded information because it
contains a form of the original plaintext that is unreadable by a human or computer without t
he proper cipher to decrypt it. Thus preventing loss of sensitive information via hacking.
Decryption, the inverse of encryption, is the process of turning ciphertext into readable plaintext.
Ciphertext is not to be confused with codetext because the latter is a result of a code, not a cipher.
